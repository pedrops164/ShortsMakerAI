# Reddit to TikTok Automation

<div align="center">
  
_Automatically transform top Reddit threads into viral TikTok content_

</div>

## 🚀 Overview

This application automatically scrapes top threads from Reddit (currently focused on r/AskReddit), transforms them into engaging TikTok videos with text-to-speech narration, and posts them to a designated TikTok account on a daily schedule. The entire process can be ran autonomously on a virtual machine without requiring manual intervention.
